Connect Riddle&Code Tags to BichchainDB
=======================================

The RiddleAndCode platform provisions secret keys representing physical objects, persons, institutions, contracts, etc... on own smart tag devices and on public ledgers or blockchains. Basically our architecture is blockchain agnostic and works with every blockchain supporting multisignature transactions and smart contracts.

The BigchainDBstub exemplifies this consequently through a connection to a federated BigchainDB instance.

## Setup

Before working with tags and blockchain several things have to be set up:

- Provision TagTok
- Install RethinkDB locally and federated on Amazon Cloud Services
- Install BigchainDB
- Install Python3 and several Python modules

## Provision TagTok

Follow the initial example of programming a Riddle&Code Half-Bean

## Install RethinkDB locally
