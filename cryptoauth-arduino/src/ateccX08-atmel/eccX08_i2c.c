/** \brief This I2C function resynchronizes communication.
 *
 * Parameters are not used for I2C.\n
 * Re-synchronizing communication is done in a maximum of three steps
 * listed below. This function implements the first step. Since
 * steps 2 and 3 (sending a Wake-up token and reading the response)
 * are the same for I2C and SWI, they are
 * implemented in the communication layer (#eccX08c_resync).
  <ol>
     <li>
       To ensure an IO channel reset, the system should send
       the standard I2C software reset sequence, as follows:
       <ul>
         <li>a Start condition</li>
         <li>nine cycles of SCL, with SDA held high</li>
         <li>another Start condition</li>
         <li>a Stop condition</li>
       </ul>
       It should then be possible to send a read sequence and
       if synchronization has completed properly the ATECCX08 will
       acknowledge the device address. The chip may return data or
       may leave the bus floating (which the system will interpret
       as a data value of 0xFF) during the data periods.\n
       If the chip does acknowledge the device address, the system
       should reset the internal address counter to force the
       ATECCX08 to ignore any partial input command that may have
       been sent. This can be accomplished by sending a write
       sequence to word address 0x00 (Reset), followed by a
       Stop condition.
     </li>
     <li>
       If the chip does NOT respond to the device address with an ACK,
       then it may be asleep. In this case, the system should send a
       complete Wake token and wait t_whi after the rising edge. The
       system may then send another read sequence and if synchronization
       has completed the chip will acknowledge the device address.
     </li>
     <li>
       If the chip still does not respond to the device address with
       an acknowledge, then it may be busy executing a command. The
       system should wait the longest TEXEC and then send the
       read sequence, which will be acknowledged by the chip.
     </li>
  </ol>
 * \param[in] size size of rx buffer
 * \param[out] response pointer to response buffer
 * \return status of the operation
 * \todo Run MAC test in a loop until a communication error occurs and this routine is executed.
